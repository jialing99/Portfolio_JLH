                <h2>Break the industry (Design)</h2>
                <hr><br>
                <p>"More people each year are turning to video games as a form of entertainment. According to The Entertainment Software Association 42% of all homes in the United States have at least one video game console.(The Entertainment Software Association, 2010) With this number so high, the need for game developers is constantly growing. Even so, there are an incredible number of people wishing to join the gaming industry.
                One area of particular interest is game design. To those with a passion for gaming this could be a dream come true."</p>

                <h2>Matrix</h2>
                <hr><br>
                <p>In this short animation, I wanted to recreate the mythic movie called Matrix. Specifically, the scene when Neo, the protagonist, needs to make the decision between the two pills, blue and red, that represent different ways of reality. The blue pill represents the reality that Neo know. In that part, I use the effect called CC Kaleida to give a kaleidoscope effect in the background. Also, the circle is moving in a circle and its colors change when the song starts to distort. The song is called "Happy Together" by Turtles. I picked this song because in the beginning, it starts with a sad and melancholic melody but the lyrics represent something happy. All of these represent that the reality of Neo, which is repetitive and boring but is ok. However, he needs something more. Consequently, he pick the red pill, which is intense ("Le Castle Vania - John Wick Medley" song) and chaotic (letters that represent the matrix, reality that Morpheus know).</p>
